**Section 1: Adherence to Principles of Universal Design and Potential Future Enhancements**

*Principle 1: Equitable Use*

The name input field for signing up and adding friends allows for non-ascii characters to include people of diverse cultural backgrounds. For future enhancements, we could add accessibility options, such as text-to-speech for visually impaired users or larger font sizes for users with vision difficulties.

*Principle 2: Flexibility in Use*

Solo play allows users to explore the points of different creative combinations of words in a non-competitive environment, while the other game modes e.g., competition within league and between friends appeal to competitive users. Flexibility is built into the game modes so the users have the option to choose their preferred game style.

*Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use*

Most actions in the game e.g., signing up, logging in, joining a league, adding a friend are straightforward and don’t necessitate extra explanations. For future improvements, for actions that are less obvious to navigate, we could provide a tutorial on the home page so the users know how to add a word to a category and that clicking on a friend can trigger a 1v1 comparison screen.

*Principle 4: Perceptible Information*

No high contrast colours are used, and colour is not the only way to convey information. The go home buttons are labelled with the symbol “←” as an alternative way to display information.

*Principle 5: Tolerance for Error*

Tolerance for error is reflected in the fail views and error messages to guide the user. All the main views are equipped with a go home button so the user won’t be “stuck” in a particular view if they misclick.

*Principle 6: Low Physical Effort*

Low physical effort is readily attained given the small scope of this program. User actions involve only typing and mouse clicks.

*Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use*

The software can run on various environments like Windows, macOS, and Linux, which is a common feature of all Java programs. Due to the digital nature of this product, this principle is less applicable.

**Section 2: Target Users**

Generally, students and other young adults can all use the program for entertainment and feedback on their journalism acumen. Within this broader demographic, we would market the program towards people with particular interest in journalism and/or pop culture. These individuals are likely to be engaged with news trends; thus they would have more motivation to predict and analyze future news headlines in a gamified way. Additionally, the competitive league aspect makes the program attractive to friend groups or study cohorts who enjoy collaborative and competitive activities.

**Section 3: Vulnerable Group**

A group who may struggle to use the program is people who are less familiar with western culture. The program has competitive features like rankings and 1v1 comparisons for points, in which wins and losses are determined partially by luck but also by intuition about what words and topics will be covered by the newspaper during a specific time. Since these people are not part of the majority in the context of a program written in English and dependent on articles from Guardian, a British newspaper, this can diminish their sense of relational equality. At least indirectly, our software design may discourage this group from using the program.
